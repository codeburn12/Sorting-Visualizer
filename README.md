# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer Project! This project is designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms in action.

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer Project is an interactive tool that helps users understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a visual representation of the sorting process, making it easier to comprehend the underlying logic of each algorithm.

## Getting Started

You can view a live demo of the Sorting Visualizer Project [here](https://sorting-visualizer-pink.vercel.app/).

- A modern web browser
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/codeburn12/sorting-visualizer
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd sorting visualizer
```
3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort
- Adjustable array size and speed control to observe the sorting process at different scales and speeds.
- Step-by-step visualization with color-coded bars to represent elements being compared and swapped during sorting.
- User-friendly interface with controls for starting, pausing, resetting, and selecting different algorithms.

### Usage

- Open the Sorting Visualizer Project in your web browser.
- Adjust the array size and speed controls as desired.
- Select a sorting algorithm from menu.
- Click "Start" to begin the visualization of the selected sorting algorithm.
- Observe the step-by-step sorting process and the visual representation of array elements being sorted.
- Use the controls to pause, reset, or select a different algorithm as needed.

### Technologies Used
The Sorting Visualizer Project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
